# Prompt for Cursor

Analyze my project and automatically generate or update the `.cursor-rules.mdc` file to ensure Cursor's assistant:

- Aligns with my component-based, modular structure.
- Writes well-documented Python, JavaScript, and React code.
- Follows best practices for Flask and Railway deployment.
- Proactively suggests improvements, but avoids breaking existing functionality.
- Reminds me to back up code before major changes.
- Uses markdown formatting and asks clarifying questions when needed.
- Don't use bootstrap. Use Flask + Jinja + Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI for the Rally application.

Make sure the rule structure follows the proper `.mdc` format.
